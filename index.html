<h4>Students Performance Analysis</h4>

        <p>
        ​In this report, I analyzed student's performance dataset and tried to find out, why students do fail their classes. Both logistic regression and linear regression models are presented. The first one makes the classification, trying to predict, whether the student will fail his/her class or not. The second, linear regression, model predicts final grades of the students, that did not fail. Both models show good prediction accuracy both on training and test data sets. Some discussion about significant factors can be found at the end of the report.

<h4>Machine Learning in Board Games</h4>

        <p>
Unsupervised machine learning programs for playing some simple board games are considered. For the simplest one, naught and crosses game on a 3 × 3 board the program has found an optimal strategy without any prior knowledge about the game. In the case of a more complicated game on 5 × 5 playing board, the program sometimes makes errors, missing the evident winning moves.
