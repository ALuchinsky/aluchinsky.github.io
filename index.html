        The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead, and the state of each cell changes based on the states of its neighbors. In this project, I implemented the Game of Life using JavaScript, allowing users to interactively play the game and observe how patterns evolve over time.

        <p>
        ​In this report, I analyzed student's performance dataset and tried to find out, why students do fail their classes. Both logistic regression and linear regression models are presented. The first one makes the classification, trying to predict, whether the student will fail his/her class or not. The second, linear regression, model predicts final grades of the students, that did not fail. Both models show good prediction accuracy both on training and test data sets. Some discussion about significant factors can be found at the end of the report.

        The subject of the project is the analysis of available Stock Market Prices data since the pandemic using the Functional Data Analysis (FDA) approach. The data were cleaned and transformed before the analysis using FDA. We applied functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and functional clustering (FC) to the data. Using FDA, the companies were clustered into an optimal number of groups required to explain the observed variation, after that the analysis and comparison of the clusters’ content was performed. Our results show that during the pandemic period (from March 13,2020 to the exact date) mostly increasing trends were observed, but the increasing trends are different from one cluster to another. Interesting findings on the industry sections and obtained clusters are also elaborated based on FC results

In this report, we study the impact of COVID- 19 on several US states and how the disease compares with historical causes of death, and it’s potential contribution to excess deaths when compared to an equivalent historical time frame. We provide insights into how our data can support excess death analysis in the future, and reflect on the significant challenges, highlighted by our study, for future research in comparing COVID-19 datasets.
